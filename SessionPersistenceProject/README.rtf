\f0\fs24 \cf0 - This folder contains all the code developed in part of my thesis.\
\
- Should run as is as long as the configuration is correct in the deployment descriptor (check thesis for more info)\
\
- Code includes timers in code that were used in benchmarking, meaning that if run there is a lot of output in Java console.\
\
- Note that the experimental Kryo serialization implementation is broken with Vaadin 7.1+\
\
- The .ucls files are UML diagrams drawn using objectAid plugin\
\
- The javamelody jar in WEB-INF/lib is a monitoring tool and is not needed for the actual implementation\
